# SOLID

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open / Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

### Single Respoinsibility

A class should only have one responsibility.

### Open / Closed

A class should be opened by extend but should be closed by change.

### Liskov Substitution

A sub class should be replaceable to be parent class.

### Interface Segragation

Upper module shouldn't depends on lower module. both of modules depends on abstract.

### Dependency Inversion

Keep interface simple.
